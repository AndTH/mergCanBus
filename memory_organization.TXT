Memory organization
512 bytes
byte=value;explanation
1=0xaa ; indicates that it is a merg arduino memory storage
2=can_id;store the can_id
3=hh Node number;high byte from node number
4=ll Node number;low byte from node number
5=hh device number;high byte from node number
6=ll device number;low byte from node number
7-32=25 bytes for node variables
32-153=120 bytes for 30 learned events
154-304=150 bytes for learned event variables. 2 bytes for each variable. 1st is the event number index
