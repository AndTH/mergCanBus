Memory organization
512 bytes is the max value for simple arduino
byte=value;explanation
0xaa ; indicates that it is a merg arduino memory storage
can_id;store the can_id
hh Node number;high byte from node number
ll Node number;low byte from node number
flags
hh device number;high byte from node number
ll device number;low byte from node number
amount of node variables
amount of learned events
amount of learned event variables
25 bytes for node variables
120 bytes for 30 learned events
150 bytes for learned event variables. 2 bytes for each variable. 1st is the event number index. the index is the position of the event in the memory range from 1 to 30
